**MaChIAto** (**M**MEJ-**a**ssisted **Ch**rommosomal **I**ntegration **A**nalysis **to**ols) is a third-party tool of CRISPResso and CRISPResso2.
MaChIAto can perform stricter re-classification of the output of CRISPResso(2). Also, The tools accommodate other functions for profiling a tendency of knock-in reads.

MaChIAto is designed to analyze amplicon sequence including HDR- or MMEJ- assisted knock-in reads. However, the tools are also available for knock-out analysis.
